# Restaurant Billing System
The Restaurant Billing System is a user-friendly program developed in Python that allows restaurant owners to easily and accurately calculate the total bill of their customers. With this billing management system, restaurant owners can easily fill in the blank boxes with item quantities and click on the total button to get the final bill. The program is designed to automatically include service charges and state taxes in the total bill, ensuring that the customer is charged accurately. This billing system can be used in various food businesses, including restaurants, cafes, and food trucks, and it can calculate bills quickly, saving valuable time for the business owners. The program is easy to operate, and users can quickly learn how to use it without encountering any errors or warnings. The design of the system is simple yet effective, allowing users to navigate the program with ease. To further enhance the user experience, a calculator has been added to the billing system that performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This feature helps to streamline the billing process, making it even more efficient and accurate. The system displays the menu, order number, total bill, and reset option, making it easy for users to view and manage their orders. We guarantee that the project is free of bugs and is designed to meet the needs of food business owners, making it an ideal solution for efficient billing management.
